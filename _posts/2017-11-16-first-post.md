This is my first entry to this blog. In fact, it's also my very first blog. I've never thought I'd have anything interesting to tell, let alone on a regular basis to justify the effort to create something like a blog for it. But as I just realized, I was piling up more and more braindumps and "semi-documentations" for various projects I am/was working on. A lot of them are only text files scattered around on local disks or my fileserver, some ended up in various wikis and were more or less carried over when I replaced them with another wiki.  
I've been using git quite heavily for configuration management but actually never thought about using it for archiving my notes. Finally coming to this (rather obvious) conclusion, I now hope this repository might become the "final" common place for all these braindumps/notes/walkthroughs/whatever-you-may-call-it. It being a blog is more of a side-effect, but maybe some of the stuff I babble about might be useful to someone else one day when stumbling over a similar problem.  
 
  
That being said, here's a short disclaimer about what you will find here:  
I'm a UNIX- and networks admin, so this blog will be (mostly?) of a technical nature. All I do "with computers" (or to them) and especially all my scripting and programming is either to get my job done or even just purely recreational and a hobby. I'm not a trained programmer or sysadmin - most of my knowledge is self-taught, the rest was learned the hard way.  
Most of what I'll commit to this repo will be only some more or less polished notes and documentations I've kept for myself. I'll try to generalize some things if applicable and/or possible, but some of it might still make some heavy assumptions about the infrastructure or the way things are set up. I make heavy use of jails/zones, vlans, all kind of automation and especially ansible, so don't expect full examples for manual configuration as I usually automate the heck out of everything.  
 
So for everything you might find here: Please apply common sense and use your own brain, I might be biased and/or completely wrong.
 
 
_Thanks,_
